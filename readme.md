== Description==

LinkedIn is awesome, but if you want a printable-version of the Profile you so carefully crafted,
too bad.  There is (currently) no good way to get a good-looking printable version.

So I made this.

The Convert LinkedIn Profile to Printable Chrome Extension only loads when you are viewing your LinkedIn Profle page. When it has loaded, 
you will see a new icon inside the right edge of your address bar (blue arrow, pointing onto a paper-like image).  And to convert 
that page into a printable resume, all you have to do is click that icon.

By injecting just a little CSS into tha page, you have something printable.

== Installation ==

1. You can either download and install directly from here, then install as an unpacked Chrome Extensions (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked), or can install this extension directly from the Chrome Web Store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/convert-linkedin-profile/banjooknkfddfmhhndbheeajkfeaigaa)
2. Once installed, navigate to your LinkedIn Profile page (I recommend using "View profile as: Connections")
3. Once the page loads, a new icon should appear at the right-edge of your address bar
4. Click the icon
5. Your Profile should immediately transform into a page that looks good on the screen and prints well.
